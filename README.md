### Problem Statement

Management and ownership of patient's data in healthcare.

For every hospital a patient visit, he/she has a case file (a file which comprises of patient's medical history) and over time these data become disjointed as a result of the different case files for different hospitals.

### Solution

This project aims to solve this problem by saving the patients data on the blockchain where it can be accessed and retrieved in any hospital the patient authorizes to have access. The data is owned and managed by the patient and this can lead to a higher level of trust the patient can have.
